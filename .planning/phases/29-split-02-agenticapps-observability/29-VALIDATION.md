# Phase 29 — Validation Strategy

> Per-phase validation contract for feedback sampling during execution.
> Derived from `29-RESEARCH.md` § Validation Architecture. The new obs repo has NO test
> infrastructure at phase start — almost everything is a Wave 0 gap (the repo doesn't exist yet).

## Test Infrastructure

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Framework** | bash (`migrations/run-tests.sh`, sourcing `vendor/agenticapps-shared/migrations/lib/*.sh`) + vitest (per-stack template tests) |
| **Config file** | `migrations/run-tests.sh` in the NEW obs repo — **Wave 0 creates it** (source-and-keep shim, obs-specific SKILL.md path at repo root) |
| **Quick run command** | `bash migrations/run-tests.sh 0019` / `0021` / `0022` (filter to migration under test) |
| **Full suite command** | `bash migrations/run-tests.sh` (in `~/Sourcecode/agenticapps/agenticapps-observability`) |
| **Estimated runtime** | ~60–120s full suite (40 moved fixtures: 0012=5, 0013=5, 0017=11 [7 pass/4 XFAIL], 0018=2, 0019=13, 0021=4 + new 0022 + consumer-axis drift via migrations/MIGRATIONS_VERSION) |

---

## Sampling Rate

- **After every task commit:** Run `bash migrations/run-tests.sh <migration_id>` (filtered)
- **After every plan wave:** Run `bash migrations/run-tests.sh` (full obs suite)
- **Before `/gsd-verify-work`:** Full obs suite green + `/observability *` AND `/add-observability *`
  both resolve + `git log --follow` verified on ≥3 moved files
- **Guard (do NOT regress the source repo):** `bash migrations/run-tests.sh` in **claude-workflow**
  still reports `PASS=186 FAIL=4` (Phase 29 only COPIES out; it must not change claude-workflow).
- **Max feedback latency:** ~120 seconds

## Per-Task Verification Map

## Wave 0 Requirements

- [ ] New repo `agenticapps-eu/agenticapps-observability` created + `vendor/agenticapps-shared` submodule @ v1.0.0
- [ ] `migrations/run-tests.sh` — obs shim (source-and-keep; obs SKILL.md path = repo root, NOT `skill/SKILL.md`)
- [ ] `migrations/0022-*.md` + `migrations/scripts/migrate-0022.sh` — new deferred-fix migration
- [ ] `migrations/test-fixtures/0022/` — fixtures for the new migration (incl. immediate-flush regression + #61 types.d.ts real shape)
- [ ] `legacy/SKILL.md` — `add-observability` deprecation alias
- [ ] `install.sh` — dual-symlink install (with clobber-guard mirrored from claude-workflow install.sh:88-95)
- [ ] `vitest` available per stack: `cd templates/<stack> && npm install`

*The 0019 (13) + 0021 (4) fixtures are MOVED (not authored) — they arrive green via filter-repo.*

## Manual-Only Verifications

| Behavior | Why Manual | Test Instructions |
|----------|------------|-------------------|
| Slash commands fire in a fresh Claude Code after install | Skill-loader cache is client-side; not scriptable from the repo | Run `install.sh`, reload skills, type `/observability` and `/add-observability` — both list/resolve |
| GitHub repo visibility/push landed | Outward-facing, user-gated (`autonomous: false`) | `gh repo view` + confirm push after the checkpoint |

---

## Validation Sign-Off

- [ ] All tasks have `<automated>` verify or Wave 0 dependencies
- [ ] Sampling continuity: no 3 consecutive tasks without automated verify
- [ ] Wave 0 covers all MISSING references
- [ ] No watch-mode flags (vitest uses `run`, not watch)
- [ ] Feedback latency < 120s
- [ ] `nyquist_compliant: true` set in frontmatter (planner sets after filling the map)

**Approval:** pending
